### Design

* [https://www.figma.com/file/3CJh1KDBSXHzUqqN3THmcD/Todos?node-id=0%3A](https://www.figma.com/file/3CJh1KDBSXHzUqqN3THmcD/Todos?node-id=0%3A1)

### The app must be capable of doing the followings:

1. Add task
2. Edit task
3. Delete task
4. Mark as done
5. See whatâ€™s done
6. Show progress (e.g. 40% done)

### Requirements

1. React based.
2. Connect with API [https://github.com/datawowio/todos-json-server](https://github.com/datawowio/todos-json-server).
3. You cannot use CSS frameworks (e.g. Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.). Please create your own layout using CSS-in-JS, or SCSS.
4. Make a layout with CSS grid, or CSS Flexbox.
5. Bug-free, look as close to the design as possible.
